# CompletedGamesList
A tool to generate a list of completed games for use in Steam descriptions, as seen on my profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rallymen007/profile/

## Files required
Along the .exe file, you will need 2 different files:
-header.txt : contains the fixed header to be added to every generated file
-games.csv : contains a CSV representation of your game list following this format:

Platform,GameName,is100,Comm

An example file is present in the repository.
